/*
  Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a similar program in the
  Easy exercises, but this time the requirements are a bit different.

  Build a madlibs program that takes a text "template" as input, plugs in a
  selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that text,
  and then returns it. You can build your lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and
  adverbs directly into your program. Your program should read this text and,
  for each line, place random words of the appropriate types into the text and
  return the result.

  The challenge of this program isn't just about writing your solutionâ€”it's
  about choosing the structure of the text templates. Choose the right way to
  structure your templates and this problem becomes much easier. Consequently,
  this exercise is a bit more open-ended since the input is also something that
  you'll define for yourself.

  Examples:

  Note: The quotes in the example strings returned by the madlibs function are
  only shown for emphasis. These quotes are not present in the actual output
  strings. The words in quotes come from the list of texts and it is the madlibs
  function that puts them there without quotes.

let template1 =
  "The %{adjective} brown %{noun} %{adverb} " +
  "%{verb} the %{adjective} yellow " +
  "%{noun}, who %{adverb} %{verb} his " +
  "%{noun} and looks around.";

let template2 = "The %{noun} %{verb} the %{noun}'s %{noun}.";

function madlibs(template) {
  const wordSet = { adjective: ["quick", "lazy", "sleepy", "noisy", "hungry"],
    noun: ["fox", "dog", "head", "leg", "tail", "cat"],
    verb: ["jumps", "lifts", "bites", "licks", "pats"],
    adverb: ["easily", "lazily", "noisily", "excitedly"],
    selectRandom(objProp) {
      return wordSet[objProp][Math.floor(Math.random() *
        wordSet[objProp].length)];
    }};

  return template.split(' ').map(val => {
    if (val.slice(0, 2) === '%{') {
      if (val.indexOf('}') !== -1) {
        return wordSet.selectRandom(val.slice(2, val.indexOf('}'))) +
          val.slice(val.indexOf('}') + 1);
      } else {
        return '\nERROR please enter a valid template using ${part_of_speech}, for' + 
        ' random input!\n';
